* clone inside ~/repos, cd into the file. 
* ensure that both .sh files can be executed, this is done like so:
* chmod 700 *.sh

* exit vim (:q to close first pane then again to exit)
* you are done :D, i recommend reading throught the .bashrc and .vimrc to see my keybinds/ aliases/ commands/ scripts so you know what you can use :D
