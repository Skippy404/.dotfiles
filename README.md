# .dotfilesMinimal
My setups used for my raspberry pi's/ VM's etc  

## __INSTALLING__  
* clone inside ~/repos, cd into the file. 
* ensure that both .sh files can be executed, this is done like so:
* chmod 700 *.sh 
* to install: ./install.sh (options will show up, you can quit anytime by hitting ctr-c)
* open vim (a warning will popup just press enter) and type :PlugInstall
* exit vim (:q to close first pane then again to exit)
* open your terminal preferences and select a powerline font, example Hack-Regular, to enable powerline fonts
* you are done :D, i recommend reading throught the .bashrc and .vimrc to see my keybinds/ aliases/ commands/ scripts so you know what you can use :D  
##__TL;DR__  
just run this
`cd  
mkdir repos  
cd repos  
git clone https://github.com/skippy404/.dotfilesMinimal  
cd .dotfilesMinimal  
chmod 700 *.sh  
./install  
`
