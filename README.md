My setups used for my raspberry pi's  

## __INSTALLING__  
__THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH POWERLINE-FONTS, I HAVENT AUTOMATED THE INSTALL OF THIS YET SO PLEASE INSTALL IT FIRST (STRICTLY SPEAKING IT ISNT NEEDED, BUT IT MAKES THE AIRLINE FONTS PLUGIN LOOK A TAD WIERD, THE ARROWS ARE MISSING) AS YOU NEED SUDO RIGHTS, AND ON THE NARGA MACHINES I DO NOT HAVE THIS ACCESS__  
  
* clone inside ~/repos, cd into the file. 
* ensure that both .sh files can be executed, this is done like so:
* chmod 700 *.sh 
* to install: ./install.sh (options will show up, you can quit anytime by hitting ctr-c)
* open vim (a warning will popup just press enter) and type :PlugInstall
* exit vim (:q to close first pane then again to exit)
* you are done :D, i recommend reading throught the .bashrc and .vimrc to see my keybinds/ aliases/ commands/ scripts so you know what you can use :D
